# C# Robot programming

This repository contains code for Devoteam's programming assignment. There are no unit tests, as I am not experienced in those.

You can download the compiled files for Windows machines [here](https://github.com/mobra/DevoteamRobot/releases/tag/1.0.0).

Once extracted, simply double-click on
#### `DevoteamRobot.exe` 
to launch the robot controller.
